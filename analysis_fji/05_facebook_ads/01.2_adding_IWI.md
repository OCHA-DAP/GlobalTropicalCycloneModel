```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
```


```python
base_dir = Path(os.getenv("STORM_DATA_DIR")) / "analysis_fji/02_new_model_input/"

grid_dir = base_dir / "02_housing_damage/output/"
IWI_dir = base_dir / "05_vulnerablility/output/"
```

Load IWI (this is just at municipality level, sadly) and grid files


```python
IWI = pd.read_csv(IWI_dir / "fji_rwi_bygrid_new.csv")
grid = pd.read_csv(grid_dir / "numbuildings_per_grid_0.01.csv")
```

Merge with new grid definition


```python
df_merged = IWI.merge(grid, on='grid_point_id')

# Save it
df_merged.to_csv(grid_dir / 'grid_0.01_bld_locations.csv', index=False)
```
