# Data exploration

Here we explore the impact data, fixed it (woring spelling of typhoon names and locations) and we create an output clean version of the dataset

## Codes

-  In 00.1 we create an output dataset ``impact_data_clean_hti.csv`` that provides people affected at ADM1 and ADM2 level.

-  In 00.2 we explore (make some plots) of the impact data for building damage (created in ```02_data_collection/06_population_data```).
